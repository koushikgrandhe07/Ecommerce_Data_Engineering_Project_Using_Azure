# Ecommerce_Data_Engineering_Project_Using_Azure
This data engineering project leverages ETL processes to ingest, transform using Azure services. Raw data from GitHub and SQL tables is ingested via Azure Data Factory, processed in Azure Databricks, enriched with MongoDB, and stored in ADLS Gen2. The transformed data is then analyzed using Synapse for actionable insights.
